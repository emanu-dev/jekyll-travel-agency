A forest is an area of land dominated by trees. Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing and ecological function.

Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem of Earth, and are distributed around the globe. More than half of the worldâ€™s forests are found in only five countries (Brazil, Canada, China, Russian Federation and United States of America).
