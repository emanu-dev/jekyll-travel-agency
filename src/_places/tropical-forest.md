Tropical forests are forested landscapes in tropical regions: i.e. land areas approximately bounded by the tropic of Cancer and Capricorn, but possibly affected by other factors such as prevailing winds.

The tropical domain has the largest proportion of the worldâ€™s forests (45 percent), followed by the boreal, temperate and subtropical domains.
